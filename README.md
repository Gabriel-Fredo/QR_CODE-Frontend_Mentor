## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS 

### What I learned

I learned more about centering and how to apply it to the page in a way that works, a little about web design and how to use divs for layout. (And currently training my English, sorry for any spelling mistakes XD)

```html
<div class="qr-code-container">
    <div class="qr-code-box">
      <img src="./src/images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR Code Image" />
```
```css
.qr-code-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
    width: 100vw;
}
```

### Continued development

About centralization and web design... This is ABSOLUTELY an area I will continue to study in the future, as 90% of the time I spend on the project is on design and in indecisions related to it.

### Useful resources

- [DevMedia](https://www.devmedia.com.br/como-centralizar-divs-em-html-e-css/37568) - this REALLY helped me center the div (I always forget how to do this XD). I will definitely use it more often.
